# OctoAcme Project Management Docs — README

Welcome! This README introduces OctoAcme’s project management processes and links to the key documents in this folder. It's intended as a single entry point for contributors and new team members to quickly understand how we plan, execute, and improve cross-functional projects.

OctoAcme runs projects through a lightweight, repeatable lifecycle: Initiation → Planning → Execution → Release → Retrospective. Initiatives begin with a Project One‑pager that captures the problem, measurable outcomes, stakeholders, and timeline. Planning turns approved initiatives into a prioritized, estimated backlog with clear acceptance criteria and a Definition of Done. Execution is tracked on a visible project board (Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done) with small, well-described pull requests, CI checks, and an explicit PR review policy to keep changes small and reviewable.

Roles and ownership are explicit: Product Managers focus on outcomes and prioritization, Project Managers coordinate delivery and communications, Developers implement and test, QA validates acceptance criteria, and Stakeholders provide inputs and approvals. Key artifacts — project charter/one‑pager, roadmap and release plan, sprint backlog, risk register, and retrospective action items — capture decisions and make responsibilities traceable.

Communication follows a predictable cadence to keep alignment and surface risks: daily standups for the delivery team, weekly PM + PdM syncs, regular demos, and monthly stakeholder updates. Quality and risk management are embedded in the workflow: unit/integration tests, end‑to‑end smoke tests before releases, CI security scans, a living risk register with owners and mitigations, and an incident/rollback playbook. Retrospectives close the loop by converting learnings into tracked action items so the process continuously improves.
